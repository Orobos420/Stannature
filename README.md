Stan Nature

The goal of this project is to create a website that allows users on campus to report of the local wildlife they see with various community engagmemt aspects. 

Description: The way this will work is from someone's terminal we haven’t chosen who yet, One person will upload the files to Tomcat which we have installed on the terminal that will use our IP, but will look to change when we make it StanNature.com. There will be code connecting we will be using PHPMyAdmin as the main way to do Sql because we can’t all use the same one so each person designated to a piece of code will be using their own until one person will just use one that is connected to all of the code. We will use JSP, CSS, Javascript, Java, and Mysql as a database. The
